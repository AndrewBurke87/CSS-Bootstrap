this is a basic starter portfolio that includes a simple about me contact page and an introduction. Still working on it and I wasn't sure what to put on my portfolio so be gentle... so here's a picture of a baby duck. lol the site links the three pages through the navbar at the top of the screen. i added a responsive image as well as a grid any feedback would be great still trying to get the hang of these readme.md files.

Here is the link to my repository https://andrewburke87.github.io/CSS-Bootstrap/
I could not get the screenshot to display I kept getting a 404 error.
